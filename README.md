# URL Shortner Code Challenge!!
## Purpose of the App:
This is a one page website which shortens a URL. That's it. That's all it does. Cerise and I made it (mostly Cerise). Be pleased with it!

## Technologies:
- Python
- Flask
- sqlite3
- Bootstrap
- HTML and CSS

## Installation and Usage:
### Installation -
- First clone down this repo and mosey on over to the folder you cloned it down to.
- Open the directory with a text editor of your choice
- Create a virtual environment using `pipenv shell`
- Install all the dependencies required using `pipenv install`
- You'll have to run `python init_db.py` to intialise the database.

### Usage -
- To run this web app with it's intended functionality, type `pipenv run dev` in the terminal 
- This will run the webapp on your localhost with the respective port defined in the url specified in the terminal.
- Please visit the respective URL... sorry, no this is insulting to your intelligence at this point. You know how to click a link! 

## Challenges:

- CSS in general. 
- Bootstrap styling had some hiccups with it not working, and not actually adding the styling to the page, we had to use the `!important` code line to overwrite some stuff.
- I'm still not entirely sure if the shortened URLs actually take you to the intended site. 
## Wins:
- It exists?
